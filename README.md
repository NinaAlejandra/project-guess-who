# Guess Who

A game where you need to guess who is the chosen person. 

## The problem

Since Javascript is new to me and I'm still learning, I approached this by studying with other people and trying to figure out things together. When I studied alone, I studied how others solved the same issues and tried to understand what they did to learn. 
If I had more time, I would solve the weird issue that appears when you finish the game. For one, the layout doesn't look good. And another thing is that the game doesn't restart, and this is something I want to fix.
